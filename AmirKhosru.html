                BNP Standing Committee member Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury on Monday said the current interim government is disregarding everything necessary for a transition to democracy. <br><br>

“As a result, the country is heading towards uncertainty. Under the circumstances, neither the budget nor economic policies will have any effect,” he said. <br><br>

The BNP leader was speaking at a pre-budget discussion titled “Policy Reforms and the Upcoming National Budget” in the capital.
<br><br>
Special Assistant to the Chief Adviser Anisuzzaman Chowdhury was the chief guest, while Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Distinguished Fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya presented the keynote paper at the event.
<br><br>
Amir Khosru said, “It is the main responsibility of this government to take the necessary steps to steer Bangladesh toward a democratic transformation.
<br><br>
"Right now, the people are thinking about where they are heading, what lies ahead for Bangladesh, how long the government will stay, when the elections will be held, and what will happen to the country afterward. We see no certainty in any of these issues.”
<br><br>
Mentioning that the upcoming budget is being prepared based on a questionable GDP (gross domestic product) growth, he said the interim government in fact maintained continuity of the previous fascist government’s budget and nothing has been done differently to bring about any meaningful change.  
<br><br>
Terming the humanitarian corridor with Myanmar sensitive, Amir Khosru said the issue must be dealt with based on a political decision. He, however, raised the question of how the interim government could make such a decision without any discussion with the relevant stakeholders.
<br><br>
“We need to be tolerant. Even if we disagree with others, we must respect their chosen path. Without bringing about this political change alongside economic transformation, we will not be able to move forward. Therefore, we must move beyond confrontational politics,” the BNP leader observed.
